Frequently asked questions and our answers.

If you can't find what you're looking for, please contact us.

## Why adding songs to library failed?

We've received some feedback from some users that the interface keeps pending. This is a network issue with Apple Music. If you can't add music in Music Plus, it will also take longer to add music to your library in Apple Music app. The current solution is to try again after a while.

## Control buttons lose response for a few seconds at first launch

When Apple Music is not running, it takes some time for iOS to launch and respond to our requests. We are now working on this issue and are sorry for your poor experience.

## Why song artwork image lost?

If you listening stream musics, the artwork loaded from Apple Music online. It depends on network qualitity.

If you listening library music, this case may less appear, due to artwork image store in local.

## How to restore my purchase?

Click any premium feature such as "Landscape battery...", then app will show a card about Music Plus Pro. Click "Restore Purchase" and wait, App Store will sync your purchase info.
